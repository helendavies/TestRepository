This is a pretend chemistry set just to investigate how GitHub works :)


Now I make some more changes.


And now some more. 

But I want to park this version now and leave it as it is, making any new changes in a new version.

So now, these are new changes that I want to put on a new branch called TesterBranch.

More changes on TesterBranch.

Iâ€™m going to work on my chemistry set here!

H     some numbers
O     some numbers
HE0    some numbers
H2O   some numbers
OH    some numbers
E     some different new numbers
H^    some numbers

E + H2O > H^ + OH + E     some more numbers
