This is a pretend chemistry set just to investigate how GitHub works :)


Now I make some more changes.


And now some more. 

But I want to park this version now and leave it as it is, making any new changes in a new version.

But actually I want to make changes on master branch…

So now I really am going to leave master branch alone, work on my “chemistry set” on the TesterBranch and attempt to merge the 2 in a while…
